## Question 10

Is List a thread-safe collection?

1. For read operations only 
2. Is't in any way 
3. For write operations only
4. Is in all cases

Answer: 2 <br/>
**FYI. It is safe to perform multiple read operations on a List<T>, but issues can occur if the collection is modified while itâ€™s being read**
